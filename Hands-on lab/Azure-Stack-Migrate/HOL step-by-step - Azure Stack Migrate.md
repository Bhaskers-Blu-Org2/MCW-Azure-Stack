# Azure Stack Migrate hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you will deploy the Azure Stack Hub Development Kit and deploy the SQL Database and Azure App Service resource providers, as well as download several virtual machine images from the Azure Stack Hub Marketplace. From there, you will implement a full taxonomy in Azure Stack Hub consisting of a region, subscription, plan, offer, and quotas. After Azure Stack Hub is configured, you will then deploy Azure SQL Database, Web and API apps and then deploy the Contoso application.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be better able to deploy and manage solutions running on Azure Stack Hub.

## Overview

Contoso Finance is one of the largest banks in the United States with a significant amount of their revenue coming from their residential mortgage business. As part of Contoso's shift to a cloud first strategy they planning to migrate their loan web applications to a hybrid cloud solution. During the planning stages, Contoso realized they would not be able to retain their customer data in US based Azure regions due to corporate compliance policies and regulatory issues. They have selected Azure Stack Hub as the deployment method to take advantage of Azure technologies while still maintaining compliance.

## Solution architecture

![The Microsoft Azure Stack Hub is made up of Mortgage Applications and Mortgage Admin databases, Offerings API, Storage Queue Mortgage Applications, Mortgage Applications, and SQL Web App DB and Customer Data.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureStackimages/media/image2.png "Solution Architecture")

## Exercise 4: Automating backend processes with Azure functions 

Duration: 15-30 minutes

Contoso wants to automate the process of generating applications in PDF format by using Azure Functions. In this exercise, you will provision a Function App using the Azure Stack Hub portal. This Function App will watch the Azure Storage Queue for a message that the web application has submitted, process the application creating a PDF and storing it in Azure Blob Storage.

### Task 1: Create an Azure function to generate PDF receipts

1.  From your Azure Stack Hub Host, navigate to the following repository: and select **Clone or download**, and then **Download ZIP**. After the file is downloaded, extract it to a new folder named **C:\\HoL**.

    ```
    https://github.com/opsgility/contosofinancefunction
    ```

    ![In the Azure Stack Hub Host, the Clone or download button is selected, and under Clone with HTTPS, the Download ZIP button is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureStackimages/media/image139.png "Azure Stack Hub Host")

2.  From the User portal, select **+Create a resource -/> Web + Mobile -/> Function App**.

## After the hands-on lab 

Duration: 10 minutes

In this final task you will clean up the Azure Resources that you have create for the hands-on lab. This task is optional.

1.  If provisioned using the Azure Stack Hub Development Kit in an Azure VM, delete the resource group your Azure Stack Hub Host VM is running in.

2.  If running on your own Development Kit, delete all the resource groups from the Azure Stack Hub portal that you created during the execution of this lab.

You should follow all steps provided *after* attending the Hands-on lab.
